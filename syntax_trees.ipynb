Always the food is good, I drink strong alcohol and very good things. They give me two slices of good that show the flower – and very good, I enjoy them. I enjoy them very much, the \"toast\" that I drink. Now, I will return you here!\n",
      "My wife took me here for my birthday for dinner and it was amazing.  The weather was nice so we enjoyed sitting outside and looking at their farm.  Our server was super friendly and our food arrived promptly on the busy Saturday morning.  It seemed like the place filled up pretty quickly so getting here early is best. Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was amazing and just the best I’ve ever had.  I know they only use ingredients from their garden and cook it when you ask.  It was so beautiful. While everything on the menu looks good, I had the scrambled eggs and it was so soft and fluffy.  It came with two pieces of their toast with it was delicious and really made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had. Either way, I can’t wait to go back!\n",
