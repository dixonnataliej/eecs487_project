Do yourself a favor and try their Bloody Mary. It was very good, and it felt like a really great moment in my life. I believe what they use to make it is fresh, taken straight from their garden, and they prepare it anew each time. It truly touched me deeply. Every single thing on the menu was enjoyable. I personally had an easy time with the two halves of toast, grilled just right, and satisfying — that’s what made this a full and worthy breakfast. That was the best toast I’ve ever had in my life.
